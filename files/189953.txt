Beschlusskontrolle zu A0773/13 (Sitzungsnummer: SR/065/2014)
EU-Förderstrategie für Dresden entwickeln -Wirtschafts- und Wissenschaftsstandort stärken,
sozialen Zusammenhalt fördern

Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,

folgender Zwischenstand kann zu oben genanntem Beschluss gegeben werden:
„Die Oberbürgermeisterin wird beauftragt,

1. ein integriertes Strategiekonzept zu entwickeln für den Einsatz und den Umgang
mit den EU-Strukturfondsmittel für die kommende Förderperiode 2014 - 2020. In die
Erarbeitung des Konzeptes sollen die Vertreter der von den Fördermöglichkeiten
betroffenen sozialen Verbände und Einrichtungen sowie Wirtschafts- und For
schungsinstitutionen einbezogen werden. Das Konzept ist dem Stadtrat bis 1. Sep
tember 2014 zur Beschlussfassung vorzulegen."

Das Strategiekonzept für den Einsatz und den Umgang mit den EU-Strukturfördermittel für
die kommende Förderperiode befindet sich aktuell in der Analysephase. Die Federführung
zur Beantwortung wurde letzten Endes an den Geschäftsbereich Wirtschaft übertragen. Alle
Geschäftsbereiche waren aufgefordert, über die bisherige Praxis zu berichten.
Dabei ist Folgendes festzuhalten:
a) Insbesondere die GB Stadtentwicklung/Bau, Soziales und Wirtschaft beteiligen sich
an jeweils unterschiedlichen Programmen auf Basis jahrelang gesammelter Erfahrun
gen und Kenntnisse.

b) Bei diesen Programmen wird direkt bzw. indirekt mit den von den Fördermöglichkeiten
betroffenen Verbänden und Einrichtungen sowie Wirtschafts- und Forschungsinstituti
onen zusammengearbeitet.

c) Eine zentrale Übersicht über alle Programme sowie deren mögliche Passfähigkeit auf
die Dresdner Situation und Belange existiert nicht.

d) Für ein Programm „Horizon 2020" wurde eine Analyse erstellt, welche Teile wie auf
den Standort Dresden zutreffen und wo sich ein Engagement lohnt (siehe Anlage).
Verbesserungspunkte/nächste Schritte:
1) Analyse weiterer ausgewählter Programme nach Vorlage der Analyse zu „Horizon
2020"

2) Zentrale Steuerung durch das BOB (die inhaltliche Arbeit verbleibt in den Geschäfts
bereichen)

3) Etablierung einer Facharbeitsgruppe GB-übergreifend sowie eine regelmäßige Runde
der Fachbereichscontroller zur Erbringung Eigenmittel und Vormerkung möglicher
Afa/Folgekosten unter Leitung BOB

2. „sich gegenüber der Staatsregierung für eine gezielte Einbindung der sächsischen
Kommunen gemäß dem von der EU geforderten Partnerschaftsprinzip in die Er
arbeitung der Operationellen Programme einzusetzen."
Das Partnerschaftsprinzip bei der Erarbeitung der operationeilen Programme und die Mitwir
kung der Kommunen wird bereits praktiziert. Mittels des Sächsischen Städtetags werden zen
tral alle Kommunen abgefragt (siehe Anlage). An der bisher gelebten Praxis soll sich aus
Sicht der Verwaltung nichts ändern. Die Abfrage/Beantwortung würde zukünftig über BOB,
Abteilung „Europäische und internationale Angelegenheiten" gesteuert und verwaltet.
3. „eigene Zielvorstellungen und Anforderungen, die sich aus der spezifischen
Dresdner Situation ergeben, gegenüber der Staatsregierung ausreichend zu vertre

ten. Über die spezifischen Zielsetzungen sind die Ausschüsse für Allgemeine Ver
waltung, Ordnung und Sicherheit, Soziales, Gesundheit und Wohnen, Umwelt und
Kommunalwirtschaft, Stadtentwicklung und Bau, Finanzen und Liegenschaften,
Wirtschaftsförderung sowie Kultur bis 30. September 2014 zu informieren."
Die Zielsetzungen werden in der Regel durch die Themen und die Verankerung im Haushalt
gesetzt. Anschließend/parallel erfolgt die Anfrage/Einwerbung von Fördermitteln. Die spezifi
sche Dresdner Situation stellt sich durch die politischen Weichenstellungen im Stadtrat dar.
Die Verwaltung wird keine eigenen Zielsetzungen formulieren.
4.

„sich für eine Vereinfachung und Beschleunigung des Abrechnungsprozederes,
insbesondere für kleinere Projektträger, einzusetzen."

Die Abrechnungsprozesse sind an die Projektträger gebunden, die sich wiederum nach den
Vorgaben der EU richten. Die Vorgaben der EU wurden in Sachsen eher eng ausgelegt, so
dass Prüfungszeiten teilweise sehr viel länger als in anderen EU-Regionen sind. Gerade im
Kleinprojektefonds (Ziel 3), wo die ausgereichten Mittel verhältnismäßig gering sind, wäre
eine Reduzierung des Prüfungs- und Dokumentationsumfangs wünschenswert. Der Erste
Bürgermeister Hubert, in seiner Funktion als Präsident der Euroregion, hat zudem auf diesen
Umstand mehrfach hingewiesen und diesen Wunsch an die Staatsregierung herangetragen.

Um kleinere Projektträger zu unterstützen, die mit diesen Vorgängen/Prozessen noch nicht
vertraut sind, wird angeregt, ein ideelles Mentoring durch die Mitarbeiter abzubilden, die För
dermittel abrechnen und Wissens- sowie Erfahrungsträger sind.
Mit freundlichen Grüßen

Kenntnisnahme:

1 Einführung Horizon 2020
Die Struktur von Horizont 2020 enthält drei getrennte, wenngleich sich gegenseitig verstärkende
Schwerpunkte:
Ein Großteil der Fördergelder wird zur Lösung von Herausforderungen aufgewendet. Die Projekte sollen
Beiträge dazu liefern, wie z. B. dem Klimawandel, dem demografischen Wandel oder der prekären
Welternährungslage begegnet werden kann. Hierfür gibt es den Schwerpunkt 'Gesellschaftliche
Herausforderungen', in welchem die Politik die drängendsten Forschungsthemen benennt.
Mit dem Schwerpunkt 'Führende Rolle der Industrie' wird insbesondere die industrielle Forschung und
Entwicklung eingebunden. Schlüsseltechnologien und industrielle Technologien fördern nicht nur neue
Produkte und damit mehr Wettbewerbsfähigkeit. Forschungsergebnisse in diesen Bereichen, wie etwa
neuartige Materialien, Minicomputer oder biotechnologische Erkenntnisse, können auch eine wichtige
Grundlage für andere Forschungsbereiche sein und z. B. zur Lösung von gesellschaftlichen
Herausforderungen beitragen.
Der Teil Wissenschaftsexzellenz strebt danach, die besten Köpfe in Europa in allen Phasen ihrer
wissenschaftlichen Karriere zu unterstützen. Ziele dieses Schwerpunkts sind u. a. die bessere
Vernetzung von Forschenden sowie die Ermöglichung von Forschungsaufenthalten in anderen Staaten.
Für Forschung und Innovation sollen Wissenschaftlern und Wissenschaftlerinnen weltweit führende
Forschungsinfrastrukturen zur Verfügung gestellt werden.
Daneben verfolgt das Programm noch weitere Ziele. So sollen forschungs- und innovationsschwächere
Regionen an das Spitzenniveau herangeführt werden. Außerdem sollen Wissenschaft, Forschung und
Innovation stärker in der Gesellschaft verankert werden. Die Gemeinsame Forschungsstelle (JRC) setzt
Forschungsaufträge um, um der Politik eine verlässliche Entscheidungsbasis bereitzustellen. Das EIT
vereint das Dreieck des Wissens aus Bildung, Forschung und Innovation.
Zusätzlich gibt es noch eine Reihe von übergreifenden Aspekten. Mehr Informationen zur Struktur von
Horizont 2020 finden Sie im nächsten Abschnitt.

2 Struktur von Horizon 2020
Die Struktur des EU-Rahmenprogramms für Forschung und Innovation, Horizont 2020, gliedert sich in
drei Schwerpunkte und vier zusätzliche Teilbereiche. Horizont 2020 führt viele bewährte
Programmbereiche aus dem 7. EU-Forschungsrahmenprogramm, dem Rahmenprogramm für
Wettbewerbsfähigkeit und Innovation (CIP) und dem Europäischen Institut für Innovation und
Technologie (EIT) fort.
"Wissenschaftsexzellenz" als wissenschaftsgetriebener Schwerpunkt besteht aus folgenden
Einzelzielen:
 Der Europäische Forschungsrat (ERC): Vergibt individuelle Grants an exzellente
Nachwuchskräfte und etablierte Wissenschaftlerinnen und Wissenschaftler mit
bahnbrechenden Projektideen;
 Künftige und neu entstehende Technologien - Future and Emerging Technologies (FET):
Vergibt in drei Förderschemen Grants an Forschungsverbünde für die Erforschung neuartiger
Ideen;
 Marie-Skłodowska-Curie-Maßnahmen:
Fördert
die
Mobilität
von
Nachwuchswissenschaftlerinnen und -wissenschaftlern;
 Forschungsinfrastrukturen: Fördert die Vernetzung bestehender Forschungsinfrastrukturen,
ermöglicht dadurch mehr transnationalen Zugang (die Nutzung der Einrichtung durch
Forscherinnen und Forscher aus verschiedenen Ländern) und treibt die gemeinsame
Implementierung von Forschungseinrichtungen und -anlagen von gesamteuropäischem
Interesse voran.
"Führende Rolle der Industrie" als industriegetriebener Schwerpunkt setzt sich aus den folgenden
drei Einzelzielen zusammen:
 Grundlegende und industrielle Technologien, inklusive Schlüsseltechnologien: Fördergelder für
Forschung und Innovation in Bereichen, die für die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der Industrie
besonders relevant sind (Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologien (IKT),
Nanotechnologien, Fortgeschrittene Werkstoffe, Biotechnologie, Fortgeschrittene Fertigung und
Verarbeitung, Raumfahrt);
 Zugang zur Risikofinanzierung: Kreditfazilitäten und Beteiligungskapital, um Gelder für riskante
Forschungs- und Innovationsvorhaben zu generieren;
 Innovation in KMU: Gezielte Förderung von Kleinen und Mittleren Unternehmen (KMU) entlang
der gesamten Innovationskette, inklusive Machbarkeitsstudien, Förderung von Forschung und
Demonstration sowie Unterstützung in der Follow-up-Phase.
"Gesellschaftliche Herausforderungen" als politikgetriebener Schwerpunkt besteht aus sieben
Herausforderungen. Hier sollen interdisziplinäre Lösungen für übergreifende Probleme gefunden
werden, die Einzelstaaten alleine nicht lösen können. Die Herausforderungen sind:
1. Gesundheit, demografischer Wandel und Wohlergehen;
2. Ernährungs- und Lebensmittelsicherheit, nachhaltige Land- und Forstwirtschaft, marine,
maritime und limnologische Forschung und Biowirtschaft;
3. Sichere, saubere und effiziente Energie;
4. Intelligenter, umweltfreundlicher und integrierter Verkehr;
5. Klimaschutz, Umwelt, Ressourceneffizienz und Rohstoffe;
6. Europa in einer sich verändernden Welt: integrative, innovative und reflektierende
Gesellschaften;
7. Sichere Gesellschaften – Schutz der Freiheit und Sicherheit Europas und seiner Bürger

3 Allgemeine Teilnahmebedingungen und Förderquoten
An Horizont 2020 können sich alle Rechtspersonen eines EU-Mitgliedstaats, eines assoziierten Staats
oder eines Drittlands beteiligen. Bei den Rechtspersonen kann es sich um natürliche Personen oder
juristische Personen (d. h. privatrechtlich oder öffentlich-rechtliche Einrichtungen) handeln.
Vertragspartner der Europäischen Kommission bei Vorhaben in Horizont 2020 ist in der Regel die
Einrichtung (z. B. Universität, Hochschule, Forschungsinstitut oder Unternehmen), wenn eine natürliche
Person gemeinsam mit ihr einen Antrag gestellt hat (z. B. weil diese natürliche Person bei der
Einrichtung angestellt ist). Dies gilt auch für individuelle Fördermaßnahmen, wie beispielsweise
Stipendien – hier reichen die Antragstellenden den Antrag gemeinsam mit der Gasteinrichtung ein.
Grundsätzlich müssen an einem Forschungsprojekt mindestens drei voneinander unabhängige
Einrichtungen aus jeweils drei unterschiedlichen EU-Mitglied- oder assoziierten Staaten beteiligt
sein. In den meisten Fällen liegt die Anzahl der Partnereinrichtungen an erfolgreichen Projektanträgen
jedoch (zum Teil weit) über dieser Mindestanforderung. Zusätzliche Anforderungen an die Teilnahme
sind im jeweiligen Arbeitsprogramm verankert.
Wer kann gefördert werden?
Förderfähig sind natürliche und juristische Rechtspersonen aus allen EU-Mitgliedsstaaten sowie die
dem Rahmenprogramm assoziierten Staaten. Darüber hinaus werden Partner aus den
Entwicklungsländern und den Länder der Erweiterungs- und Nachbarschaftspolitik finanziell gefördert.
Forschende aus den Industrie- und Schwellenländern können zwar in Horizont 2020 teilnehmen,
erhalten für die Beteiligung aber in der Regel keine finanzielle Förderung.
Teilnahme außerhalb von Kooperationsprojekten
Es gibt Bereiche in Horizont 2020, bei denen die Möglichkeit besteht, als Einzelpartner einen Antrag auf
Förderung zu stellen. Dies ist der Fall bei der Beantragung von Pionierforschungsvorhaben im Rahmen
von Ausschreibungen des Europäischen Forschungsrats (European Research Council, ERC), im
Bereich der Koordinierungs- und Unterstützungsmaßnahmen (Coordination and Support Activities,
CSA-Maßnahmen) oder des Instruments zur Förderung kleiner und mittelständischer Unternehmen
(KMU), sofern ein europäischer Mehrwert gegeben ist. Zudem besteht diese Möglichkeit bei
Maßnahmen der Kofinanzierung von Programmen, bei einzelnen Marie-Skłodowska-Curie-Maßnahmen
und in weiteren, im jeweiligen Arbeitsprogramm festgelegten und begründeten Fällen.

4 Kurzbeschreibung der Projektformen
Forschungs- und Innovationsmaßnahmen
Forschungs- und Innovationsmaßnahmen (Research and Innovation Actions) werden in Form von
Verbundprojekten durch Konsortien mit Partnern aus verschiedenen Ländern durchgeführt. Ziel der
Maßnahmen ist die Entwicklung neuen Wissens, neuer Technologien, Verfahren, Produkte und
Dienstleistungen. Sie umfassen Grundlagen- und angewandte Forschung und können in begrenztem
Rahmen Pilot- oder Demonstrationsmaßnahmen enthalten. Auch Test und Validierung von Prototypen
im Labormaßstab oder simulierten Umfeld sind möglich.
Die Förderquote für Forschungs- und Innovationsmaßnahmen beträgt 100 %.
Innovationsmaßnahmen
Innovationsmaßnahmen (Innovation Actions) werden ebenfalls in Form von Verbundprojekten
durchgeführt. Ziel der Maßnahmen ist die Erarbeitung von Plänen, Konzepten und Vorkehrungen für
neue, verbesserte Produkte, Verfahren oder Dienstleistungen. Sie umfassen z. B. die Erstellung von
Prototypen, Tests, Demonstrationen, Pilotprojekte sowie die Produktvalidierung in großem Maßstab und
Entwicklung der Marktfähigkeit.
Demonstrationsprojekte oder Pilote zielen dabei darauf ab, die technische und wirtschaftliche
Durchführbarkeit z. B. eines neuen Produktes, Prozesses oder einer neuen Technologie in der
jeweiligen Einsatzumgebung zu validieren.
Marktumsetzungsprojekte zielen auf die erste Anwendung einer Innovation ab, die bisher aufgrund
von Marktversagen oder Einführungshemmnissen noch nicht angewendet bzw. eingesetzt werden
konnte.
Die Förderquote für Innovationsmaßnahme beträgt grundsätzlich 70 %. Gemeinnützige (non-profit)
Einrichtungen erhalten auch hier eine Förderquote von 100 %.
Koordinierungs- und Unterstützungsmaßnahmen
Koordinierungs- und Unterstützungsmaßnahmen (coordination and support actions) dienen der
Vernetzung von Projektpartnern, z. B. mit Hilfe von Konferenzen, Seminaren, Studien, politischen
Dialogen oder gemeinsamen Initiativen. Darüber hinaus können sie Maßnahmen zur Normung,
Verbreitung, Sensibilisierung und Kommunikation sowie ergänzende Tätigkeiten zur Vernetzung und
Koordinierung von Programmen zwischen verschiedenen Ländern umfassen.
Die Förderquote für Koordinierungs- und Unterstützungsmaßnahmen beträgt max. 100 %.
Maßnahmen der Kofinanzierung
Bei Maßnahmen der Kofinanzierung werden nationale oder regionale Fördereinrichtungen, die
Forschungs- und Innovationsprogramme verwalten, bei einzelnen Ausschreibungen oder Programmen
finanziell unterstützt. Beispiele sind die in Horizont 2020 neu eingeführten ERA-NET-CofundProgramme.
Öffentliche Auftragsvergabe
Im Rahmen der vorkommerziellen Auftragsvergabe und der Vergabe öffentlicher Aufträge für innovative
Lösungen soll der öffentliche Sektor ermutigt werden, innovative Güter oder Dienstleistungen, die auf
große Qualitäts- und Effizienzverbesserungen im öffentlichen Interesse abzielen, zu beschaffen.

10

Fördermöglichkeiten für Kommunen und Verbände in H2020, Stand 15.05.2014

Öffentlich-private Partnerschaften
Öffentlich-private Partnerschaften (PPP) zielen auf eine stärkere Einbindung der Industrie und eine
bessere Verzahnung von nationalen und regionalen Aktivitäten ab. Es wird dabei zwischen
vertraglichen PPPs und den Gemeinsamen Technologieinitiativen nach Art. 187 AEUV (Joint
Technology Initiatives, JTI) unterschieden.
Öffentlich-öffentliche Partnerschaften
Die öffentlich-öffentlichen Partnerschaften sollen eine engere Zusammenarbeit der Mitgliedstaaten und
assoziierten Staaten in bestimmten Themenbereichen fördern. Sie werden z. B. durch ERA-NETMaßnahmen und die sog. 185er-Maßnahmen umgesetzt.
Preise
Eine neue Förderform ist die Vergabe von Preisen, die in Horizont 2020 als Anreiz (inducement) zur
Lösung bestehender Probleme genutzt werden soll. In den Arbeitsprogrammen werden hierzu klar
definierte Probleme ausgeschrieben und entweder die beste oder die zuerst eingereichte Lösung
prämiert.
KMU-Maßnahmen
Auch in Horizont 2020 wird es eine gezielte Förderung von Kleinen und Mittleren Unternehmen (KMU)
geben. Neu ist, dass die Unterstützung in drei Phasen entlang der gesamten Innovationskette – von
Machbarkeitsstudien über Forschung und Demonstration bis hin zur Markteinführung - verläuft und auch
Einzelunternehmen gefördert werden können, wenn ein europäischer Mehrwert besteht.

Kurzzusammenfassung:
Standardisierungs- und Marketingmaßnahmen für intelligente Transportsysteme -> Bezug zu VAMOS
Geforderter Inhalt der Projekte (scope):
Coordination and Support Actions should support the accelerated take-up and deployment of crosssystems/cross-border innovative services and global reach-out
– by fostering further ITS standardisation in the EU and beyond in view of interoperability;
– by raising awareness and campaigning for cooperative ITS.
Research and innovation actions should address the development of one or several of the following
domains:
· Open in-vehicle platform architecture for provision of real-time ITS services and mechanisms to
provide seamless connectivity, interoperability and secure flow of information across stakeholders,
including convergence of Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) and 4th generation mobile
communication technologies.
· Improved positioning technology, building on innovative features of European GNSS systems, with
standard interfaces to serve different ITS applications and new concepts for flexible charging based on
guaranteed positioning.
· Highly accurate, dynamic maps for transport applications, leveraging technologies based on advanced
GNSS and cloud computing.
· Innovative solutions for cooperative network management, multimodal transport services, safety
applications and hazard warnings.
· Tailor-made solutions for heavy duty vehicles, integrating as much as possible tachograph, tolling,
inspection and (dynamic) route guidance functions, etc.
The activities should support development of European Wide Service Platforms (EWSP). Proposed
solutions should be demonstrated in real-life conditions, based on which the assessment of their
effectiveness and their respective deployment requirements should be carried out. They have to
propose robust built-in data privacy and security measures.The scope of the work should extend
towards full-scale early deployment, and should address issues related to suitability for public
procurement, identification of (multi-stakeholder) business cases and value-added scenarios, users’
acceptance and willingness to pay. Priority will be given to proposals with strong participation of
innovative SMEs and to proposals boosting international cooperation. Robust and convincing
commercialisation strategy in view of market roll-out of proposed solutions will be an advantage.
In line with the Union's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation international
cooperation is encouraged.

Komplettbeschreibung des Aufrufs:
Specific challenge: Europe would be closer to solving problems related to congestion, traffic safety and
environmental challenges if people, vehicles, infrastructure and businesses were connected into one
cooperative ecosystem combining integrated traffic and transport management with new elements of
ubiquitous data collection and system self-management. Significant technological progress in this area
has been made in the past years; however, large scale deployment is in its infancy. Additional research
is needed to improve and demonstrate at a European scale the effectiveness and efficiency of
integrated smart mobility solutions based on human-vehicle-infrastructure communication. Seamless
integration of the benefits offered by the European Global Navigation Satellite System (European
GNSS) in ITS applications will play an important role.
Scope: Coordination and Support Actions should support the accelerated take-up and deployment of
cross-systems/cross-border innovative services and global reach-out
– by fostering further ITS standardisation in the EU and beyond in view of interoperability;
– by raising awareness and campaigning for cooperative ITS.
Research and innovation actions should address the development of one or several of the following
domains:
· Open in-vehicle platform architecture for provision of real-time ITS services and mechanisms to
provide seamless connectivity, interoperability and secure flow of information across stakeholders,
including convergence of Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) and 4th generation mobile
communication technologies.
· Improved positioning technology, building on innovative features of European GNSS systems, with
standard interfaces to serve different ITS applications and new concepts for flexible charging based on
guaranteed positioning.
· Highly accurate, dynamic maps for transport applications, leveraging technologies based on advanced
GNSS and cloud computing.
· Innovative solutions for cooperative network management, multimodal transport services, safety
applications and hazard warnings.
· Tailor-made solutions for heavy duty vehicles, integrating as much as possible tachograph, tolling,
inspection and (dynamic) route guidance functions, etc.
The activities should support development of European Wide Service Platforms (EWSP). Proposed
solutions should be demonstrated in real-life conditions, based on which the assessment of their
effectiveness and their respective deployment requirements should be carried out. They have to
propose robust built-in data privacy and security measures.
The scope of the work should extend towards full-scale early deployment, and should address issues
related to suitability for public procurement, identification of (multi-stakeholder) business cases and
value-added scenarios, users’ acceptance and willingness to pay.
Priority will be given to proposals with strong participation of innovative SMEs and to proposals boosting
international cooperation. Robust and convincing commercialisation strategy in view of market roll-out of
proposed solutions will be an advantage. In line with the Union's strategy for international cooperation in
research and innovation international cooperation is encouraged. The Commission considers that
proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 to 10 million euro for Research and
Innovation Actions would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this
does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: The establishment of an integrated transport "info-structure", relying on vehicle to
vehicle (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communications, but also on the availability of open and
quality transport data, will improve transport systems
– safety level, by reducing the number of crashes
– efficiency, by offering efficient and cost-effective solutions for curbing congestion
– flexibility, by providing alternative options to drivers in case of traffic disruptions
– sustainability, by cutting down GHG and other pollutant emissions

Komplettbeschreibung des Aufrufs:
Specific challenge: This topic will organise public outreach exhibitions and participatory events
throughout the whole of Europe to engage citizens in science, drawing on the experience and capacity
of science museums, Higher Education Institutions, science shops, scientific centres of excellence and
innovation hubs, cities of scientific culture (e.g. building on the Seventh Framework programme
PLACES initiative), but also grass root Do It Yourself (DiY) creative re-use communities (like
movements, etc.), secondary schools, higher education centres, Non-Governmental Organisations
(NGOs) and civil society organizations, local public authorities and other relevant stakeholders[1]. The
topic will take-up and further develop the information and training material produced by the RRI Toolkit
developed by the Seventh Framework Programme project RRI Toolkit.
Scope: Exhibitions and participatory events shall be interactive and adapted to local/regional conditions
(i.e.: use of relevant case-studies) and shall take place in the local languages. Exhibits shall provide
material for dissemination and make use of existing multimedia and other relevant technology (e.g.:
social media, virtual reality, scenarios, gaming, etc.) and shall employ inclusive participatory techniques
to engage with multiple publics (children, youth, women, adults, and other relevant stakeholders).
Alongside the exhibitions, the proposals shall also establish regular 'science cafés' in informal settings,

actors. Public feedback of exhibits and the outcomes of deliberations shall be collected and analysed in
a structured way, to guide an internal learning process and provide policy support.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and
3.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not
preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: In the short term, this action will increase public awareness of science and of
Responsible Research and Innovation. In the medium term, it will build capacity of local science actors
and public authorities to engage with citizens on science and innovation, leading to more public
engagement activities after the end of the project. Equally, it will directly encourage more citizens,
including women, to participate in science. It will encourage user-led and frugal innovation, and mobilise
social resources in the knowledge transfer of ideas - from social imagination to practical implementation.
In the long term, it will channel to policy makers at different levels external advice and societal inputs
regarding appropriate R&I policies (as per Art. 12 and 14 of the H2020 Regulation).
Type of action: Coordination and Support Actions.

Komplettbeschreibung des Aufrufs:
Specific challenge: Responsible research and innovation has the potential to make research and
innovation investments – public procurement included –, more efficient, while addressing global societal
challenges by fostering better knowledge and innovation co-production with society. It has also the
potential to draw better lessons from early warnings with a view to more efficient precautionary
approaches. However, the current research and innovation system do not routinely take into account
RRI requirements. Systemic barriers to the uptake of RRI approaches include lack of recognition in the
career system of academic research for RRI/trans-disciplinary approaches, in evaluation criteria and by
scientific journals, a lack of market incentives to internalise external costs of innovation (environmental,
social, etc.) an insufficient training of researchers, institutional barriers, etc.[1] It is key to develop
concrete policy actions to overcome these barriers and to foster systemic change, e.g. towards better
societal engagement in knowledge-production and innovation.
Scope: The action addresses systemic barriers to the implementation of Responsible Research and
Innovation in research and innovation practices. The proposals shall aim to set the ground for concrete
progress in relation to one of the various barriers (e.g. develop roadmaps, policy agendas, networks,
coordination etc. during the lifetime of the project), identifying ways for better professional recognition
and uptake of RRI approaches. Action for concrete progress could also focus on how to use existing
instruments in different ways to implement systemic change: for example stimulating RRI
implementation via using public procurement to start pre-commercial projects and to purchase
innovative and sustainable products and services.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and
1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not
preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact: The action will lower the barriers to the implementation of RRI approaches. It will lead
to structural change in current research and innovation policies and systems, which will expand and
consolidate the use of RRI methods and standards. Activities will signpost EU research teams seminal
work in this domain; they will ensure complementary action at Member States level, and set best case
examples and implementation standards for the industry. In the medium term, they will foster the
capacity of research and innovation to tackle societal challenges in close cooperation with societal
stakeholders, addressing the risks and benefits and the respect of fundamental values.
Type of action: Research and Innovation Actions.

Komplettbeschreibung des Aufrufs:
Specific challenge: The growing waste produced in Europe, particularly in urban areas, where the vast
majority of the world population are expected to live by 2050, represents a cost for society and a burden
on the environment and, at the same time, a valuable stock of resources that can be exploited.
Boosting eco-innovative solutions to prevent waste generation and promote the use of waste as a
resource, in line with the objectives of the EU Resource Efficiency Roadmap[1] and the Waste
Framework Directive[2], can enhance the natural and living environment in urban and peri-urban areas.
Developing and demonstrating such solutions in real-life environments will enhance their market uptake
and contribute to sustainable urbanisation worldwide.
Cities are more than spatially extended material artefacts; they are complex systems similar to living
organisms that use energy, air, water and nutrients and need to dispose waste in a sustainable way.
Adopting an urban metabolism perspective opens the way for innovative, systemic approaches,
involving the analysis of resource flows within cities. Integrating in this way economic, social and
environmental dynamics, it is possible to understand the socio-economically and gender nuanced
patterns of resource use and consumption, and pinpoint drivers of waste-avoiding behaviour,
manufacturing and business and public governance models.
Scope: Proposals should adopt an integrated urban metabolism approach and inter-disciplinary
research and innovation and take into account the gender dimension where relevant. Proposals should
involve active engagement of local authorities, citizens and other relevant stakeholders, using innovative
concepts such as mobilisation and mutual learning[3].
Proposals shall address the following issue:
Eco-innovative solutions: Demonstration, at an appropriate pilot scale, and market replication, of
integrated eco-innovative cost- and energy-efficient technologies, processes and services for waste
prevention, treatment, enhanced collection, recycling and recovery of high-grade valuable materials
from waste. Approaches should integrate technological and non-technological solutions, including,
where appropriate, the use of economic instruments, such as incentives for more sustainable production
and consumption patterns, and awareness raising initiatives. Proposals should include the participation
of industry, including SMEs as far as possible.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 8 and
10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not
preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Significant measurable improvements in the state of the art in waste management in
urban and peri-urban areas, and in the operationalisation of the urban metabolism approach for
sustainable urban development and reduction of environmental hazards in cities. Contribution, over the
long term, to the establishment of European research and innovation leadership in urban waste
management and prevention.
In addition, the following specific impacts are expected:
Significant improvement in cost, material and, where appropriate, energy recovery efficiency in waste
recycling and prevention in the short term. Identification of potential markets for the proposed waste
collection strategies, treatment technologies and recycled products, as well as potential for replicability
of solutions, based on a return-on-investment study on the short term. Creation, in the short/medium
term, of green jobs and/or new SMEs due to effective market uptake of innovative technologies,
processes and services, ensuring equality of access to women and men, and social inclusion.
Contribution to development of standards, validated by key industrial players, and identifying best
available and emerging techniques under the Industrial Emissions Directive.

Komplettbeschreibung des Aufrufs:
Specific challenge: The majority of the European population lives in urban environments where citizens
are frequently exposed to levels of air pollutants exceeding the limit values established by the European
directives. The sources of pollution in cities are mainly linked to urban activities such as transport and
heating. Other activities such as energy production, industrial activity, agriculture and trans-boundary
pollution play an important role. Air pollution and climate change are strongly connected and there is
therefore a need to consider both environmental and climate considerations when designing emission
abatement strategies. Integrated approaches are needed to find long-term, sustainable solutions in the
EU.
Scope: Development of technological options and strategies to fight against air pollution in urban
environments and climate change ensuring the involvement of the main pollution-generation sectors.
Proposals should include the development and application of tools in support of integrated air quality
and climate change governance in EU Member States, with the aim of designing and implementing

The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 6 and
8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not
preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Reduction of the negative effects on health and climate together with the costs
associated with air pollution in the EU. Increase compliance with the EU air quality legislation. Support
to EU air policy at EU and Member State level. Rapid market deployment of technological and nontechnological innovative solutions. Contribution to the goals of the Smart Cities and Communities focus

EE-02-2015: Buildings design for new highly energy performing buildings
Kurzzusammenfassung:
Forschung und Entwicklung für energieeffiziente Gebäude, auch mit dem Ziel, energieeffiziente
Stadtteile zu entwickeln.
Geforderter Inhalt der Projekte (scope) :
Projects should focus on development and demonstration of solutions which significantly reduce the
cost of new buildings with at least 'nearly zero-energy' performance levels, whilst accelerating
significantly the speed with which these buildings and their systems are taken up by the market. Focus
should lie on solutions for appropriate indoor air quality and comfort, design adapted to local climate and
site, passive solutions (reducing the need for technical building systems which consume energy) or
active solutions (covering a high share of the energy demand with renewable energies), building energy
management systems (where appropriate), highly efficient HVAC (e.g. low temperature systems, solar
cooling), electric and/or thermal energy storage of renewable energy onsite and nearby. Projects should
also provide solutions for automated and cost-effective maintenance of the installed equipment, and
assess differences between predicted and actual energy performance. Such differences should be
documented and minimized.
The applied solutions should address the challenge to move towards to a 'nearly-zero energy' buildings
standard at large scale with demonstration projects that go beyond 'nearly-zero energy' buildings levels
to the point where buildings are active contributors to energy production and environmental quality in
particular when new districts are planned (e.g. net-zero energy neighbourhoods). The energy balance
should be calculated by means of a LCA approach, considering i.a. embodied energy.
Projects should also focus on methods for on-site and nearby-generation of renewable energy for new
buildings (electricity as well as heating and cooling generation, e.g. heat pumps, integrated PV, or other
options) accompanying energy efficiency measures to achieve standards higher than those of 'nearly
zero-energy' buildings.
The performance of innovative technologies may be verified through technology verification schemes
such as EU Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) pilot programme [1]

Komplettbeschreibung des Aufrufs:
Specific Challenge: By the end of 2020 (2018 for buildings occupied and owned by public authorities),
all new buildings should comply with the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive obligations and thus
meet 'nearly zero-energy' performance levels using innovative, cost-optimal technologies with
integration of renewable energy sources on site or nearby. Moreover the construction of 'plus-energy'
buildings - i.e. buildings producing more energy than they consume - should also be encouraged in
order to reduce energy use whilst increasing the share of renewable energies. However the costs of
these highly energy performing buildings still represent a barrier for investors. Therefore the
construction industry needs to deliver more affordable solutions.
Scope: Projects should focus on development and demonstration of solutions which significantly reduce
the cost of new buildings with at least 'nearly zero-energy' performance levels, whilst accelerating
significantly the speed with which these buildings and their systems are taken up by the market. Focus
should lie on solutions for appropriate indoor air quality and comfort, design adapted to local climate and
site, passive solutions (reducing the need for technical building systems which consume energy) or

5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not
preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This topic will be implemented under the PPP on Energy-efficient Buildings.
The activities are expected to be implemented at TRL 5-7 (please see part G of the General Annexes).
Expected Impact: Significant increase of the share of 'nearly zero-energy' buildings with the aim of
100% market uptake by the end of 2020. Costs reductions of at least 15% compared to current
situation, with additional benefits in terms of energy reduction. Demonstration for net-zero energy
districts taking advantage of onsite or nearby-generation of renewable energy.

EURO-5-2015: ERA-NET on Smart Urban Futures
Kurzzusammenfassung:
Nicht direkt relevant, sollte aber beobachtet werden – der Aufruf richtet sich an nationale Projektträger
bzw. Programmbehörden, die dann eigene Programme zum Thema international verzahnen sollen –
das Ergebnis ist ein so genanntes ERA-Net mit eigenen Ausschreibungen. Vorteil einer zeitigen
diesbezüglichen Abstimmung mit dem BMBF? wäre, dass die später folgenden Ausschreibungen schon
konkret auf den „urban case“ Dresden zugeschnitten sein könnten.
Geforderter Inhalt der Projekte (scope):
Based on concrete urban cases, research and innovation will:
- Analyse the strengths and weaknesses of urban development as a way to shape the economic, social
and environmental needs (cf. work, education, housing, mobility, ICT, energy, logistics, health shopping,
access to public spaces, culture and leisure) of citizens and in particular the next generation in a
sustainable way;
- Identify in which way European cities can become hubs of creativity and innovation;
- Contribute to the establishment of smart urban ecosystem services, where open data, big data and
data access help to create thriving urban areas;
- Enhance understanding of urban structures, by creating new methods and tools, network approaches
to cities and analysis of the economics of urban and peri-urban areas;
- Evaluate urban areas in terms of current and future "functionalities" opportunities, including urban
public spaces and the employment of sustainable infrastructure and networks.
The following dimensions could be addressed: Urban Living Labs can be a promising option to design
research and innovation projects dealing with the multi-dimensional challenges in urban areas; a strong
comparative perspective can enhance mutual learning between cities and urban regions; a multilevel
context, taking into account the global, European, national, regional and local contexts and actors,
enables the examination of urban issues from different perspectives.
The proposed ERA-NET aims at coordinating the research efforts of the participating Member States,
Associated States and Regions in the field described and to implement a joint transnational call for
proposals with EU co-funding to fund multinational innovative research initiatives in this domain.
Proposers are encouraged to implement other joint activities including additional joint calls without EU
co-funding.

Komplettbeschreibung des Aufrufs:
Specific challenge: European cities are very important in policies aiming to create growth, jobs and a
sustainable future. More than 70% of the EU’s citizens live in urban areas. Cities are centres of
economic development, services, knowledge and creativity. But they are also the places of social
polarisation, intercultural confrontations, poverty concentration, unemployment and environmental
problems. Within a forward-looking perspective, the challenge is to identify the means and ways to
make a European city an emblematic place for attracting jobs and economic activities, transforming it
into a "hub of innovation" and ensuring social cohesion and cultural dialogue while preserving natural
resources and limiting environmental damage for the next generations.
European research and innovation should provide tools and methods for more sustainable, open,
innovative and inclusive urban areas; a better understanding of the dynamics of urban societies and
social changes and of the nexus of energy, environment, transport and land-use including the interplay
with surrounding rural areas; an improved understanding of design and use of public space within cities
also in the context of migration to improve social inclusion and development and reduce urban risks and
crime; new ways to reduce pressures on natural resources and stimulate sustainable economic growth
while improving the quality of life of European urban citizens; a forward-looking vision on the socioecological transition towards a new model of urban development reinforcing EU cities as hubs of
innovation and centres of job creation.
Scope: Based on concrete urban cases, research and innovation will:
- Analyse the strengths and weaknesses of urban development as a way to shape the economic, social
and environmental needs (cf. work, education, housing, mobility, ICT, energy, logistics, health shopping,
access to public spaces, culture and leisure) of citizens and in particular the next generation in a
sustainable way;
- Identify in which way European cities can become hubs of creativity and innovation;
- Contribute to the establishment of smart urban ecosystem services, where open data, big data and
data access help to create thriving urban areas;
- Enhance understanding of urban structures, by creating new methods and tools, network approaches
to cities and analysis of the economics of urban and peri-urban areas;
- Evaluate urban areas in terms of current and future "functionalities" opportunities, including urban
public spaces and the employment of sustainable infrastructure and networks.
The following dimensions could be addressed: Urban Living Labs can be a promising option to design
research and innovation projects dealing with the multi-dimensional challenges in urban areas; a strong
comparative perspective can enhance mutual learning between cities and urban regions; a multilevel
context, taking into account the global, European, national, regional and local contexts and actors,
enables the examination of urban issues from different perspectives.
The proposed ERA-NET aims at coordinating the research efforts of the participating Member States,
Associated States and Regions in the field described and to implement a joint transnational call for
proposals with EU co-funding to fund multinational innovative research initiatives in this domain.
Proposers are encouraged to implement other joint activities including additional joint calls without EU
co-funding.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of a minimum of EUR 5
million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not
preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Expected impact: The proposed research programme on Smart Urban Futures is expected to provide
new insights on European urban dynamics, on the localisation of economic and social activities, and the
implementation of urban innovations in small, medium and large cities, both in growing as well as
shrinking urban areas. It will have an EU comparative and EU forward-looking dimension. Through the
use of co-creation of knowledge urban stakeholders will be involved in the complete process from
concept to implementation. Emphasis will be put on the scaling-up of urban best-practices.

INNOSUP-8-2015: Measuring open innovation inputs and outputs in SMEs
Kurzzusammenfassung:
Entwicklung und Test von Methoden rund um open innovation, insbesondere in Verbindung mit Kleinund mittelständischen Unternehmen. Eventuell Bezug zum Cloud Inkubator möglich.
Geforderter Inhalt der Projekte (scope):
The project will develop methodologies to gather, measure and analyse data on open innovation.
Subsequently the project will carry out practical testing of methodologies and indicators to describe the
importance and characteristics of open innovation across countries, industrial sectors, firm size and then
develop recommendations for their further use. Specifically the activity will comprise the following
elements:
- Stocktaking of available open innovation indicators, indices and methodologies (in particular
those developed by the European Commission, OECD or private data). Assessment of their relevance
and effectiveness for use as measures of innovation activities and innovation performance in SMEs,
taking into consideration intensity and quality of collaboration.
- Development of quantitative tools to present evidence and impact of open-innovation in
SMEs. Open innovation studies are dominated by qualitative approaches, drawing heavily on in-depth
interviews and case-studies. In order to move beyond qualitative and incidental evidence, empirical
measure should be developed and validated to test the relationship between business performance and
open innovation in larger samples of firms.
- Identification of policy conditions to make open innovation a reality in SMEs. The erosion of the
closed innovation system has also resulted in a larger role for SMEs in the industrial innovation system.
Development of public policy guidelines that are in line with the open innovation paradigm, i.e. education
and human capital development, transition of funding models towards open innovation systems,
competition policy, industrial policy.
The duration of this action will be one year.

Komplettbeschreibung des Aufrufs:
Specific challenge: Innovation occurs more and more frequently in global networks. From a
policymaker’s point of view this requires the development of internationally comparable indicators to
better understand the concept of open innovation and its implications for innovation policy. R&Dintensive firms are increasingly reluctant to increase R&D spending, but rather seek to rationalize the
process by bringing in new partners or spinning out research projects. Traditional innovation measures
fail to spot these tendencies. Currently available open innovation data is also insufficient to support
business operations. There is little hard evidence, based on large-scale databases, about research
projects or other innovation activities where open innovation may play a crucial role. From the points of
view of a policymaker, detailed and comprehensive data would allow drawing conclusions regarding the
inputs into and generated outputs of open innovation to guide policy development.
Scope: The project will develop methodologies to gather, measure and analyse data on open
innovation. Subsequently the project will carry out practical testing of methodologies and indicators to
describe the importance and characteristics of open innovation across countries, industrial sectors, firm
size and then develop recommendations for their further use. Specifically the activity will comprise the
following elements:
- Stocktaking of available open innovation indicators, indices and methodologies (in particular
those developed by the European Commission, OECD or private data). Assessment of their relevance
and effectiveness for use as measures of innovation activities and innovation performance in SMEs,
taking into consideration intensity and quality of collaboration.
- Development of quantitative tools to present evidence and impact of open-innovation in
SMEs. Open innovation studies are dominated by qualitative approaches, drawing heavily on in-depth

Development of public policy guidelines that are in line with the open innovation paradigm, i.e. education
and human capital development, transition of funding models towards open innovation systems,
competition policy, industrial policy.
The duration of this action will be one year.
Expected impact:
·
Broadening of available innovation indicators from input/ output measures to indicators that
combine the quality and intensity (i.e. number of collaborative deals divided by number of employees) of
the innovation cooperation.
·
The activity will gather evidence base for the impact of open innovation in an SME context.
·
By moving from incidental evidence to time series data a convincing case for open innovation will
be verified.

SCC-01-2015: Smart Cities and Communities solutions integrating energy,
transport, ICT sectors through lighthouse (large scale demonstration - first of
the kind) projects
Kurzzusammenfassung:
Große Demonstratorenprojekte für Smart-City Lösungen. Beteiligung als „Lead“ oder „Follower“-City
möglich. Gesucht werden Projekte, die Energie, Transport und ICT möglichst ganzheitlich verbinden
und potenziell in andere europäische Städte übertragbar sind.
Geforderter Inhalt der Projekte (scope):
To identify, develop and deploy replicable, balanced and integrated solutions in the energy, transport,
and ICT actions through partnerships between municipalities and industries.
These solutions at the intersection of the three sectors will have a holistic approach and are still facing
first mover risk. These will be the lighthouse projects as identified by the Communication on Smart
Cities and Communities. Lighthouse projects will target primarily large scale demonstration of replicable
SCC concepts in city context where existing technologies or very near to market technologies (TRL 7
and more, see part G of the General Annexes) will be integrated in an innovative way.
The proposals should address the following main areas:
·
(Nearly zero) or low energy districts: through the integration and management of: i) the supply of
energy with predominant exploitation of local resources (e.g. waste heat, renewables, storage) and the
active participation of consumers (e.g. use of aggregators); ii) the cost-effective refurbishment of
existing buildings without significant disruption for tenants (use of sustainable materials) with a special
focus on residential buildings iii) the cross-cutting ICT solutions for the design and overall management
of energy/ transport systems
·
Integrated Infrastructures: through the integration of physical infrastructures such as core
networks, street scenes, lighting, industrial sites etc to create new forms of value through re-use and
repurposing. This should lead to quantifiable benefits such as reduction of capital /operational
expenditure as well as reduced carbon / energy footprints. This might also imply exploitation of
synergies between requirements for smart grids, broadband infrastructures and in general poly networks
(eg district heating and cooling).
·
Sustainable urban mobility: through the integration of energy/ fuelling infrastructure with vehicle
fleets powered by alternative energy carriers for public and private transport, including logistics and
freight-distribution. Implications on energy management, and in the case of electromobility, the impact
on the electricity grid, of the deployment of high numbers of vehicles and/or the alternative fuel blends
performance must be assessed.
The proposed proposals should address in addition to the main areas presented above a strategy that
addresses appropriate enabler actions to support the commercial exploitation of the proposal. This
includes (indicative list): commitment of authorities (even if changes of politicians/ majority, in the course
of the project); citizens' engagement and empowerment; optimising policy and regulatory frameworks;
open, consistent data and performance measurements; dissemination and unlocking the market
potentials worldwide.
According to the Communication on Smart Cities and Communities the light house projects should look
for creating partnerships between industries, academics and cities, empower citizens and ensure the
replicability of the solutions, ensure the funding from various sources[1].
Therefore each project should:
 Be realised in 2 – 3 cities or communities (light house cities or communities);
 include industry, city planning authorities which should also reflect the view of the consumer
organisations, research community, local Small and Medium Size Companies (SMEs);

31

In addition each project should co-involve 2 - 3 follower cities i.e. cities willing to contribute to
the process though the replication of solutions at the end of the project and having access to
the knowhow and results of the project and a privileged contact with the project's partners. The
involvement of the follower cities should be relevant (e.g. participating in definition of user
requirements and methodology of transferability of solutions, data collection etc.). The follower
cities should aim at improving their energy performance or the share of use of renewables (e.g.
60% reduction of primary energy for buildings, 20 - 30 % RES use for electricity as well as for
heating and cooling). EU geographical coverage conditions should be also applied.
Ensure that all proposed activities are a part of ambitious urban plan. These activities should
also lead to the development of integrated urban plans. For the lighthouse cities or communities
these plans should be finalised (e.g. those compiled for the Covenant of Mayors, Sustainable
Energy Action Plans, plans committed under the Green Digital Charter etc., but without limiting
to this list of initiatives). The urban plan shall integrate buildings planning, energy networks, ICT,
transport/mobility planning; additional issues may be addressed as well if relevant for the city.
These plans shall be submitted with the proposal as a supporting document(s).
In order to ensure the success of the lighthouse projects, the funding for the other parts of the
programme or initiative in which the lighthouse projects are embedded should be secured from
other sources, preferably private ones, but also other EU funding sources (European Structural
and Investment (ESI) funds for example), national or regional funding.
Projects should demonstrate and validate attractive business plans that allow large scale
replication of fast economic recovery in cities of varying degrees of economic conditions (from
very poor to very rich), varying sizes but significant urban areas and varying climatic conditions
to ensure high impact and replication potential .
The industrial partners and municipality authorities should engage in replicating successful
demonstration in their own and other cities, notably 'follower cities'; the replication plans are
compulsory and are part of the evaluation.
Consortia must have a clearly defined structure with roles and responsibilities properly spelled
out for all involved entities.

Besides economic sustainability, proposals must also commit to scientific and technical requirements in
support to reliability:
 Open and consistent data and interoperability of solutions in order to avoid locked –in
customers.
 Contribution to common data collection systems (e.g. as those developed by European
Commission under SCC2 of this Work Programme), measurement and disclosure methodology,
in order to facilitate a common footprint calculation methodology and other metrics (especially
for energy saving; CO2 reductions, financial savings, number of jobs created, environmental
impact etc.).
 The performance monitoring should last for a period of at least 2 years. Longer term
commitment (e.g. 5 years) will give an added value to the proposal. Consortia should develop
an integrated protocol for monitoring energy, infrastructure, mobility and governance practices
in the lighthouse projects, enabling documentation of improved performance over short and
long term periods. The monitoring protocol should be robust and viable also after the end of the
project, supporting and increasing municipal capacity over time Participants may be asked to
introduce performance data into existing data bases (CONCERTO technical monitoring data
base).

Komplettbeschreibung des Aufrufs:
Specific Challenge: The EU policy and regulatory framework in the sectors of energy, transport and ICT
supports the development of sectoral solutions, i.e. solutions with a limited degree of integration.
However, for successful and accelerated implementation in real environments such as urban ones - that
also have to take into account local specificities the test of integrated measures will pave the way for
faster market roll-out of technologies. The key challenges for Smart Cities and Communities are to
significantly increase the overall energy efficiency of cities, to exploit better the local resource both in
terms of energy supply as well as through the demand side measures. This will imply the use of energy
efficiency measures optimising at the level of districts, the use of renewables, the sustainability of urban
transport and the needed drastic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in urban areas - within
economically acceptable conditions - while ensuring for citizens better life conditions: lower energy bills,
swifter transport, job creation and as a consequence a higher degree of resilience to climate impacts
(e.g. urban heat islands effects) etc.
Scope: To identify, develop and deploy replicable, balanced and integrated solutions in the energy,
transport, and ICT actions through partnerships between municipalities and industries.

SCC-03-2015: Development of system standards for smart cities and
communities solutions
Kurzzusammenfassung:
Standardisierungsarbeiten im Zuge der Erarbeitung von smart city Lösungen. Ziel ist es , die
Übertragbarkeit von erfolgreichen Ansätzen in andere Städte möglichst problemfrei zu halten (aus
technischer Sicht). Enger Bezug zum Thema SCC-01.
Geforderter Inhalt der Projekte (scope):
Today the standards are developed for specific components or areas such as smart meters, smart grids,
ICT etc. With the development of integrated solutions of Smart Cities and Communities a system
approach is needed. Furthermore through standardisation the solutions identified by smart cities and
communities can envisage costs reductions. It is expected that this work is carried out by the industries
cities and communities contributing to the Smart Cities and Communities European Innovation
Partnership in cooperation with the European Standardisation Organisations (CEN, CENELEC, ETSI)
as well as other Standard Developing Organisations (SDOs) responsible for technical specifications in
the area of Smart Cities. Social acceptance of developed solutions might be considered.
The process for developing smart cities and communities standards should ensure
 interoperability of solutions, i.e. adaptability of solutions to new user requirements and
technological change as well as avoidance of entry barriers or vendor lock-in through promoting
common meta-data structures and interoperable (open) interfaces instead of proprietary ones;
 open and consistent data, i.e. making relevant data as widely available as possible – including
to third parties for the purpose of applications development – whilst using common, transparent
measurement and data collection standards to ensure meaningfulness and comparability of
performance/outcome measurements.
This action will cross-fertilise and cooperate with actions under topic SCC 1 – 2014/2015.

LCE-04-2015: Market uptake of existing and emerging renewable electricity,
heating and cooling technologies
Kurzzusammenfassung:
Maßnahmen zur Beschleunigung des flächenhaften Einsatzes von Lösungen in Bezug auf erneuerbare
Energien, Heizungs- und Kühlungstechniken, vor allem auch in Bezug auf Genehmigungsverfahren.
Hier Vorreiterrolle von Deutschland.
Geforderter Inhalt der Projekte (scope):
To ensure the level of growth needed to deliver the EU targets for renewable energy, and to create the
appropriate business environment for EU industrial leadership in low-carbon energy technologies, a
number of important market-uptake challenges still need to be addressed, notably:
·
Ensuring sustained public acceptance of renewable energy projects and renewable
energy overall, while taking into account the implications of the substantial increase in RES share in the
final energy consumption;
·
Ensuring speedy and user friendly permitting procedures;
·
Implementing renewable energy policies, codes and legislations at EU, national, regional
and local levels in a coordinated manner using best practice examples with significant replication
potential;
·
Capacity building and contributing to the further development of renewable energy policy,
legislation and regulation, and informing the debate on post-2020 horizons;
·
Capacity building and facilitating the deployment of improved business models and
innovative financing schemes for mobilising investments in innovative and established renewable
energy systems and services.
Proposals should address one or several of the challenges mentioned above for technologies and
systems which are at TRL 7-9 (please see part G of the General Annexes). Regional specificities, socioeconomic, spatial and environmental aspects from a life-cycle perspective shall be considered. For all
actions, the consortia should involve and/or engage relevant stakeholders and market actors who are
committed to adopting/implementing the results.
For RES electricity, actions which address exchanges of information or cooperation among different
actors (e.g. on future business models for aggregators), must demonstrate that they are promoting best
practices. Actions which are developing new recommendations or which are contributing to the debate
on costs and benefits of specific options must provide quantified indicators of the market impacts of
future policy options.
For RES heating and cooling, proposals must demonstrate that they are adopting an integrated
approach which fully respects the requirements and recommendations given in the energy efficiency
and EPBD directives. Actions aimed at promoting the use of geothermal, bio and/or solar heating for
individual, industrial or district heating applications must involve / engage with the responsible policy
makers and regulators as well as industry and potential financing bodies, and must include relevant
capacity building and adoption of best practices.

Komplettbeschreibung des Aufrufs:
Specific challenge: The legal framework established by the Renewable Energy Directive (2009/28/EC,
'RES Directive')) sets binding targets for all Member States to contribute to the overall 20% target for
renewable energy in the EU final energy consumption by 2020, and the 'Energy Roadmap 2050' shows
that renewables will have to play a much greater role in all future scenarios beyond 2020. As well as
putting in place legal obligations, the RES Directive also makes recommendations for specific actions to
be taken by the public and private sectors across the EU. However, in many areas, it leaves open the
ways in which Member States may implement policies and support measures aiming to increase use of
renewable energy at national, regional and local level.
Consequently, although some Member States have already made good progress in incentivising
renewable energy, there are still many opportunities for common learning and sharing of best practices
on the cost-effective mobilisation of new investments in renewable energy across the EU. Moreover,
such investments contribute to the European 2020 strategy for growth, job creation, industrial
innovation, and technological leadership as well as reducing emissions, improving the security of energy
supplies and reducing EU’s energy import dependence.
Since the adoption of RES Directive in 2009, most Member States have experienced significant growth
in renewable energy consumption. However, currently, we are seeing a deceleration of this growth,
partly due to the economic crisis, but also because there are a number of market uptake barriers that
remain or persist for both established and innovative renewable energy technologies.
Scope: To ensure the level of growth needed to deliver the EU targets for renewable energy, and to
create the appropriate business environment for EU industrial leadership in low-carbon energy
technologies, a number of important market-uptake challenges still need to be addressed, notably:
·
Ensuring sustained public acceptance of renewable energy projects and renewable
energy overall, while taking into account the implications of the substantial increase in RES share in the
final energy consumption;
·

Capacity building and contributing to the further development of renewable energy policy,
legislation and regulation, and informing the debate on post-2020 horizons;
·
Capacity building and facilitating the deployment of improved business models and
innovative financing schemes for mobilising investments in innovative and established renewable
energy systems and services.
Proposals should address one or several of the challenges mentioned above for technologies and
systems which are at TRL 7-9 (please see part G of the General Annexes). Regional specificities, socioeconomic, spatial and environmental aspects from a life-cycle perspective shall be considered. For all
actions, the consortia should involve and/or engage relevant stakeholders and market actors who are
committed to adopting/implementing the results.
For RES electricity, actions which address exchanges of information or cooperation among different
actors (e.g. on future business models for aggregators), must demonstrate that they are promoting best
practices. Actions which are developing new recommendations or which are contributing to the debate
on costs and benefits of specific options must provide quantified indicators of the market impacts of
future policy options.
For RES heating and cooling, proposals must demonstrate that they are adopting an integrated
approach which fully respects the requirements and recommendations given in the energy efficiency
and EPBD directives. Actions aimed at promoting the use of geothermal, bio and/or solar heating for
individual, industrial or district heating applications must involve / engage with the responsible policy

40

makers and regulators as well as industry and potential financing bodies, and must include relevant
capacity building and adoption of best practices.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 to 2
million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not
preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Increasing the share of renewable electricity, heating and cooling in the final energy
consumption. Reductions in the time taken to authorise the construction of renewable energy plants and
related infrastructure. Substantial and measurable reductions in the transaction costs for project
developers as well as for the permitting authorities, whilst still fully addressing the needs for
environmental impact assessments and public acceptance. Development of better policy, regulatory,
market support and financing frameworks, including at regional and local level.

Komplettbeschreibung des Aufrufs:
Specific challenge: Achieving sustainable urban mobility requires the adoption of new strategic planning
approaches at the local level. However, very few authorities undertake a sound analysis of trends,
develop scenarios and provide the necessary long term policies and focus. Without strengthening of
authorities' knowledge and capacities, a transformation of urban mobility planning will not be achieved.
Scope: Proposals should address one of the following domains:
·
Promoting take up of the innovative concept of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs).
Proposals from large networked groups of local authorities should include instruments and mechanisms
for information exchange to assist them in preparing and implementing SUMPs. The plans should build
on a solid methodology[1] and include quantified targets. Proposals should ensure that the plans
comprise a long-term vision, build on local consultation and interdepartmental coordination, include

newly-emerging technologies, policy-based, and soft measures.
·
Enhancing the capacities of local authorities and other stakeholders to successfully plan and
implement innovative sustainable mobility measures, technologies and tools, on the basis of reliable
data and analysis. Sustainable financing should play a key role, which means that special attention
should be given to setting up business cases, innovative procurement, the development of bankable
projects and partnerships.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 to 4
million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does
not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: The action(s) on Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans will generate a high leverage
factor, especially in regions and cities where take up is so far low and the impacts from transport are
severe. Participants should show a strong commitment on the preparation and implementation of the
plans. The action(s) on capacity building will produce validated, practical and replicable tools and
methods with guidance and training material, resulting in a maximum reach of the target audience.

MG-5.5a-2015: Demonstrating and testing innovative solutions for cleaner and
better urban transport and mobility
Kurzzusammenfassung:
Projekte sollen explizit von „Städten“ angeführt werden. Inhaltlich geht es um die Demonstration von
nachhaltigen Lösungen in Bezug auf umweltfreundliche Mobilität.
Geforderter Inhalt der Projekte (scope):
The first part of the topic addresses Innovation Actions to be carried out by city-led consortia,
composed of four to five cities, led by at least two advanced cities, which are committed to establish
living laboratories where innovative solutions can be implemented. The participating cities should
demonstrate their common interests and their vision on how they will ensure a meaningful and close
cooperation. Proposals should outline how the work will support effectively the cities' efforts to follow a
viable path towards sustainable mobility.
Each city should follow an integrated approach by demonstrating and testing under real life-conditions a
set of complementary and reinforcing mobility solutions. The solutions should combine newly-emerging
technologies, policy-based, and soft measures with a strong replication potential. They should cover an
appropriate sub-set of the eight ‘CIVITAS measure categories’: collective passenger transport; demand
management strategies; mobility management and travel awareness; safety and security; urban freight
logistics; information systems and services; and clean fuels and low emission vehicles; car-independent
lifestyles.
A thorough impact and process evaluation, on the basis of a common framework using a clear baseline
in each city, will provide qualitative and quantitative information on the results of the local solutions
implemented. The effectiveness of proposed measures in achieving local policy objectives should be
evaluated and the barriers to broad deployment identified together with recommendations on how to
overcome them. This should be accompanied by effective mechanisms for cross-fertilisation of
knowledge and best-practises among the consortium members and beyond.
Proposals may include preparatory, take up and replication actions, research activities, as well as tools
to support local planning and policy making. A demonstrated contribution to the development or revision
of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans as well as furthering the Union’s strategy for international
cooperation in research and innovation, especially with China[1], will be an advantage

Komplettbeschreibung desAufrufs:
Specific challenge: Many of Europe's urban areas are struggling to address the transport-related
challenges they are facing. New technologies and innovative measures are emerging, but they are not
taken up at a scale that is necessary to meet the targets of the Transport White Paper. Cities are
hesitating to implement innovative solutions because little information is available on their effectiveness
and on how to overcome the barriers to successful implementation. Special attention should be paid to
issues related to vulnerable groups of citizens and gender issues.
Scope: The first part of the topic addresses Innovation Actions to be carried out by city-led consortia,
composed of four to five cities, led by at least two advanced cities, which are committed to establish
living laboratories where innovative solutions can be implemented. The participating cities should
demonstrate their common interests and their vision on how they will ensure a meaningful and close
cooperation. Proposals should outline how the work will support effectively the cities' efforts to follow a
viable path towards sustainable mobility.
Each city should follow an integrated approach by demonstrating and testing under real life-conditions a

to support local planning and policy making. A demonstrated contribution to the development or revision
of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans as well as furthering the Union’s strategy for international
cooperation in research and innovation, especially with China[1], will be an advantage.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 12 to
18 million each for Innovation Actions would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Funding for major infrastructure works is not foreseen.
The second part of the topic addresses a Support Action to facilitate cooperation between stakeholders
involved in the projects under this topic, and from across CIVITAS 2020. It should further elaborate the
common ‘CIVITAS Process and Impact Evaluation Framework’, support its implementation and
contribute to local capacity building in deploying innovative mobility solutions. The action should include
a clear communication and dissemination strategy to maximise impact and ensure the continuity of the
‘CIVITAS Secretariat’ as well as links with the CiVi-Net networks.
This topic complements work under the ‘Smart Cities and Communities’ Call of the Energy Challenge.
Expected impact: The Innovation Actions will produce added-value inputs to the development of
European knowledge base on the effectiveness and impacts of innovative mobility solutions and
approaches to their successful implementation. Clear commitments and contribution from participants to
Europe-wide take up during and beyond the project are expected.

Komplettbeschreibung des Aufrufs:
Specific challenge: Public administrations need to address the new challenges posed by the evolution of
society. Financial constraints are making this task difficult. At the same time, expectations - in terms of
burden reduction and efficiency of public services - are growing.
The take-up of new technologies, such as social media and mobile technologies, leads to increased
connectivity.
The availability of open data and open services, in an open government setting support the collaborative
forms of service design and delivery and they increase transparency.
Personalised public services can arise from enabling and empowering citizens and businesses to
directly participate in the design, creation, selection and delivery of some of the public services.
Collaboration with users plays an important role in the transformation of public services. Public services
delivered or enabled by ICT need to be easy to use and shall increasingly focus on flexible and
personalised interactions with public administrations. Given the availability of data, users may be
provided more pro-active, higher quality and valuable services. This can make services more attractive
and increase collaboration. While creating growth and jobs, M-government can make services effective
by adjusting them to the way citizens are communicating and delivering them to a variety of mobile
devices in order to accommodate the on-going transition from stationary to mobile.
Transparency is an important element of the open government approach. Open data and information
lead to more transparency. Openness and technology tools can also enable monitoring of the public
sector and its performance. Transparency helps to increase accountability and trust in administrations.
Scope:
a) Innovation actions

The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and
3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not
preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
These innovation actions should include an assessment of the effectiveness as well as social and
economic impact of using these approaches to deliver the public administrations' goals. The results of
these assessments should also provide feedback into a set of recommendations for future use of these
approaches to deliver more effective public administration.

Komplettbeschreibung des Aufrufs:
Specific challenge: Public sector innovation and the modernisation of public administrations are
considered as important underlying factors for economic growth[1] and also contribute to
competitiveness.
In order to improve efficiency, effectiveness and quality of public services, the public sector needs to
implement new processes, products, services and methods of delivery. The public sector typically
combines and builds on top of existing technology elements to innovate. However, in today's financial
situation, the economical power of public administrations to pull research results into the market cannot
be ignored. In the EU, the overall market for purchases of goods, services and works by the public
sector accounts for almost 20% of GDP.
Reusing research results of emerging technologies in the public sector will require further research;
starting with identifying the specific challenges of the public sector, such as policy domain requeriments
and the needs of targeted citizens or businesses. The introduction of new technologies could lead to the
transformation of processes and better regulation. Projects should demonstrate the benefit both for
society as well as for civil servants. Research shall also explore the burdens - whether legal, human or
others - that prevent public administrations from implementing the identified emerging technologies.
This requires multidisciplinary research taking into account the societal, political as well as human
factors, including citizens and civil servants, and how they can contribute to modernising policies and
innovative services of general interest. It is also important to explore social acceptability, impact on the
improvement in public service delivery and potential benefits for citizens, businesses and society.
Such an approach enables research results to reach a potential market, while at the same time it will
help in modernising the public sector. It will take account of , and further develop, new knowledge on the
interaction between citizens and public authorities, while taking into consideration the intoduction of new
technologies in the particular context of public administrations, and explore how the uptake of emerging
technologies by the public sector can help Europe overcome the crisis. For example, how can Web 3.0
(semantic web technologies), semantic interoperability, linked open data, Internet of things, social
sensor networks, radio-frequency identification or wearable technologies, help to tackle challenges in
the public sector? How can emerging, new technologies facilitate the process of government to become
a platform allowing public and private actors to collaborate and create new services using open data
and open services? How do emerging new technologies need to be adjusted to the specifities of the
different selected policy domains of public activity?
Scope:
a) Research and innovation actions
Based on the development and use of emerging technologies and research carried out so far, activities
will support the preparation of next phases and possible validation in near to operational environment for
the implementation of emerging ICT technologies in the public sector.
The focus can be on any or several of the below:

The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and
5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not
preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b) Coordination and support actions:
The activities should aim at encouraging networking of relevant stakeholders and teams working in
these areas and to support constituency building. The dynamic, multidisciplinary network will include

specificities relevant to different policy domains of public activity. The activities will conclude with the
outlining of a roadmap for emerging research directions, in a multidisciplinary approach, taking into
consideration activities also undertaken outside the European Union.
Expected impact: This topic will explore the potential benefit of using emerging ICT technologies in
support of public sector innovation in line with the objectives of the eGovernment Action Plan 2011-2015
and identify barriers for a wider use. Integrating emerging ICT technologies to enable an efficient,
effective, environmentally-friendly, open and citizen-centric public sector will help to prepare the
transformation to the public sector of the future and to support the implementation of innovative policy
reforms adopted in different policy fields. The take-up of those technologies will encourage new
innovations for the benefit of businesses and citizens, and open new areas for socio-economic
research. Furthermore, stimulating the creation and use by the public services of emerging technologies
will help to accelerate time-to-market and open up new markets for ICT solutions across the EU.

Komplettbeschreibung des Aufrufs:
Specific challenge: The sustainability of pilot and demonstration solutions and services is broadly
perceived as one of the biggest challenges in streamlining healthcare delivery processes and in
improving cost efficiency while maintaining or improving patient safety. The pace of development has
been slow and penetration of ICT still has high growth potential in healthcare compared to other public
or private sectors.
This activity facilitates public purchasing of innovative solutions in healthcare which have not yet been
deployed on a large scale.
Scope: The proposals should improve sustainable deployment of new or improved services by
healthcare service procurers in line with the eHealth Action Plan[1]. Examples of target outcomes for
healthcare delivery may include addressing early hospital discharge, delivery of healthcare in remote,
sparsely populated and difficult to access regions, eHealth services for mobile EU patients, and pre/post
operation care outside the hospital environment.
The scope of the PPI pilot(s) is to specify, purchase and deploy ICT based solutions which can deliver
sustainable, new or improved healthcare services and improve the ecosystem in which procurement
approaches for innovative healthcare solutions are successfully applied.
Proposals should be driven by clearly identified procurement needs of healthcare organisations and
provide for appropriate public engagement:

as provide appropriate safeguards against relevant ethical and privacy issues;
 The work shall include a non-confidential, comprehensive socio-economic evidence base for
ICT investments in the field (including e.g. cost-benefit analysis, assessment of impacts, return
on investments, medical evidence, patient safety gain and user satisfaction) to facilitate the
development of sustainable business models and;
 Good practice shall be made available for replication in other regions, for example detailed
plans for larger-scale sustainable uptake as well as reference material including guidelines,
manuals and educational materials.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and
5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not
preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Expected impact:
 As applicable, contribution to regulatory and legal process development addressing possible
barriers to procurement of innovative solutions in healthcare.
 Growing awareness and successful use of public procurement by the procurers to boost
innovation in the application of ICT in the sector concerned.
 Support to interoperability and defragmentation of the market.
 Sustainable implementation of services and creation of economic conditions that support longterm development.
 More forward-looking, concerted, public sector approach to eHealth.
 Reduced fragmentation of public sector demand across a number of EU Member - or
Associated States by enabling public purchasers to collectively implement PPI strategies, which
due to their nature are better addressed jointly, or which they would not have been able to
tackle independently.
 Increased opportunities for wide market uptake and economies of scale for the supply side for
ICT based solutions and services by forming critical mass on the public demand side.
Type of action: Public procurement of innovative solutions co-fund actions.

Komplettbeschreibung des Aufrufs:
Specific challenge: Public authorities play a key role in the reduction of EU energy consumption and the
increase of renewable energy capacity. For instance Member States must produce and implement
National Energy Efficiency Action Plans (NEEAPs) and National Renewable Energy Action Plans. They
also have the obligation to produce detailed action plans in specific sectors such as the renovation of
buildings or the application of high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling
systems. Local and regional authorities are also developing plans at their own level and other public
authorities play an important role too; national energy regulatory authorities for instance should provide
incentives for grid operators (heat, cold, and electricity) to enable network users to produce renewable
energies and implement energy efficiency measures.
Doing this requires multidisciplinary skills to e.g. assess different cross-sector sustainable energy
options, according to technical, environmental, economic and social criteria. It also requires skills to
engage stakeholders in both the definition and implementation of the solutions, and to secure funding.
The situation regarding the availability of these skills depend from country to country; e.g. while certain
public authorities have a long tradition of using energy performance contracting, others have not tried
yet; or while a few Member States impose to large cities to develop urban mobility plans, such plans are
not common practice in other countries.
Scope: Proposals empowering public authorities to plan, finance and implement ambitious sustainable
energy policies and plans (for instance under the Covenant of Mayors initiative), on the basis of reliable
data and analyses. Public actors should be encouraged to look at sectors with high energy saving
potential such as buildings, industry and urban mobility. The geographical coverage should be well
justified on the basis of European added-value. Capacity building should be an integral part of project
proposals.
The following actions are part of the scope:

The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1.5
and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does
not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Impacts must be measured in terms of number of public officers influenced and
number of new or improved policies and plans. The number of final consumers impacted should also be
measured in millions of people. In addition, proposals targeting governments should also demonstrate
that they accelerate the implementation of the new Energy Efficiency Directive.

Consortia should include or engage with the relevant market actors such as industry (equipment and
fuel suppliers), installers, real estate developers, public authorities, energy services companies,
designers and end user groups / consumer associations. Due consideration should be given to costs
and reliability. Furthermore, where appropriate, proposals should devise mechanisms to secure funding
for energy efficiency investments.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1.5
and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does
not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

EE-05-2015: Increasing energy performance of existing buildings through
process and organisation innovations and creating a market for deep
renovation
Kurzzusammenfassung:
Gefördert werden Maßnahmen, die zu einer Erhöhung der Anzahl von energetischen Sanierungen in
Bezug auf Gebäude führen. Insbesondere sollen Marktbarrieren abgebaut werden.
Geforderter Inhalt der Projekte (scope):
Proposals should focus on removing market barriers. They should focus on coherent interventions
across issues and across actors to drive structural improvement in market conditions (i.e. those able to
significantly influence buildings energy use in different sectors including building owners/operators,
public authorities, construction and maintenance industry, housing associations, developers, financiers,
etc.). All building types may be covered; however the main focus should be on existing buildings, in
particular the most inefficient ones, as they represent the largest savings potential. Proposals should
create synergies by incorporating at least one of the following three elements:
 Driving product and process innovation in the construction sector to improve product offerings
by creating an early market.
 Development, testing and/or implementation of regulations; property valuation techniques;
decision-making tools for renovation strategies; quality standards; and/or inspection and
monitoring mechanisms to bridge the gap between expected and actual energy performance.
 Enabling conditions to finance deep renovation of buildings (including through process and
organisation innovation).
Optional additional activities may include:
 Support for the implementation of the recast Energy Performance of Buildings Directive in
Member States by promoting dialogue and exchange of best practices; complementing
activities of the EPBD Concerted Action[2].
 Support to the implementation of the Energy Efficiency Directive as regards its provisions on
'long-term strategies for mobilising investment in the renovation of the national stock of
residential and commercial buildings' (Article 4) and the renovation of central government
buildings' (Article 5); complementing activities of the EED Concerted Action[3]. Proposals
should not replace activities that are under the responsibility of Member States but add
European value to these activities (e.g. exchange of knowledge and experience between

Komplettbeschreibung des Aufrufs:
Specific challenge: The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive and the Energy Efficiency Directive
contain provisions to increase renovation rates, especially for public buildings. However nontechnological barriers hamper the implementation of these provisions and also prevent other market
actors in the residential and private sectors from following the example that the public sector is expected
to set.
The heterogeneity of the construction industry, the large number of companies and the relative lack of
quality standards and inspection protocols and guidelines limit the number and impact of large-scale
energy efficiency investments and the effective integration of renewable energies. Many buildings are
not commissioned and/or operated properly and energy performance certificates have not yet gained full
public acceptance. The pressure to build or renovate towards nearly zero-energy buildings means that
the building sector needs to significantly upgrade its working practices.
In addition there is a need to develop a marketplace for deep renovation[1] packages. Currently, there is
limited articulated demand from building owners for significant energy performance improvements in
existing buildings. Supply side, demand side and public authorities need to cooperate and find solutions
that drive compelling offers for building owners, and lift as many barriers as possible simultaneously.
Scope: Proposals should focus on removing market barriers. They should focus on coherent
interventions across issues and across actors to drive structural improvement in market conditions (i.e.
those able to significantly influence buildings energy use in different sectors including building
owners/operators, public authorities, construction and maintenance industry, housing associations,

Komplettbeschreibung des Aufrufs:
Specific Challenge: Evidence is needed on how the RRI approach, in particular the opening up of the
innovation process to social actors, can improve the development process and the quality of the final
outcomes of research and innovation in the industrial context. Existing initiatives such as Corporate
Social Responsibility (CSR) have set first steps but improved business governance is needed that
deeply embeds creativity, scalability, responsiveness, "glocality", circularity and societal engagement.
Scope: This action will support projects that demonstrate how to implement RRI in process development
(via stakeholder involvement, taking account of gender differences, Corporate Social Responsibility,
etc.) and in quality of the final outcomes (complying with standards relating to sustainability,
precautionary principle, gender and ethics, among others). The proposals shall foster collaboration

The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and
1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not
preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Better uptake of the RRI approach and of the gender dimension in research by
industrial actors. In the medium term, the action aims to increase public-private partnership in the
innovation process, to increase the social value and acceptability of innovation, and facilitate the
emergence of new business models that embed sustainability and social responsibility throughout the
entire business process. In the long term, it aims to contribute towards the innovation and
competiveness objectives of the Innovation Union and to enhanced ‘mainstreaming’ and standardisation
of RRI and CSR processes at the EU and Global level.

INSO-9-2015-1: Innovative mobile e-government applications by SMEs
Kurzzusammenfassung:
3 stufiges Verfahren zu allen vorstellbaren Arten von Innovationen mit sehr starkem Marktpotenzial,
vergleichbar mit Businessplanwettbewerb. Extrem hohe Konkurrenz erwartet, rein rechnerisch also sehr
schlechte Erfolgsaussichten. Beteiligung nur als Partner empfohlen, Projekte müssen
unternehmensgetrieben sein.
Geforderter Inhalt der Projekte (scope):
The SME instrument consists of three separate phases and a coaching and mentoring service for
beneficiaries. Participants can apply to phase 1 with a view to applying to phase 2 at a later date, or
directly to phase 2.
In phase 1, a feasibility study shall be developed verifying the technological/practical as well as
economic viability of an innovation idea/concept with considerable novelty to the industry sector in which
it is presented (new products, processes, design, services and technologies or new market applications
of existing technologies). The activities could, for example, comprise risk assessment, market study,
user involvement, Intellectual Property (IP) management, innovation strategy development, partner
search, feasibility of concept and the like to establish a solid high-potential innovation project aligned to
the enterprise strategy and with a European dimension. Bottlenecks in the ability to increase profitability
of the enterprise through innovation shall be detected and analysed during phase 1 and addressed
during phase 2 to increase the return in investment in innovation activities. The proposal should contain
an initial business plan based on the proposed idea/concept.
The proposal should give the specifications of the elaborated business plan, which is to be the outcome
of the project and the criteria for success.
In phase 2, innovation projects will be supported that address the specific challenge of business
transformation and that demonstrate high potential in terms of company competitiveness and growth
underpinned by a strategic business plan. Activities should focus on innovation activities such as
demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and
the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service etc) to industrial readiness and
maturity for market introduction, but may also include some research. For technological innovation a
Technology Readiness Levels of 6 or above (or similar for non-technological innovations) are
envisaged; please see part G of the General Annex.
Proposals shall be based on an elaborated business plan either developed through phase 1 or another
means. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants will have to present
convincing measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to operate').
Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project, including a first commercialisation
plan, and criteria for success.
In addition, in phase 3, SMEs can benefit from indirect support measures and services as well as
access to the financial facilities supported under Access to Risk Finance of this work programme.
Successful beneficiaries will be offered coaching and mentoring support during phase 1 and phase 2.
This service will be accessible via the Enterprise Europe Network and delivered by a dedicated coach
through consultation and signposting to the beneficiaries. The coaches will be recruited from a central
database managed by the Commission and have all fulfilled stringent criteria with regards to business
experience and competencies. Throughout the three phases of the instrument, the Network will
complement the coaching support by providing access to its innovation and internationalisation service
offering. This could include, for example, depending on the need of the SME, support in identifying

Komplettbeschreibung des Aufrufs:
Specific Challenge: Current societal and economic challenges as well as rising expectations to reduce
the burden on users, put pressure on all public administrations to provide efficient, open and citizencentric public services.
Due to the increased use of mobile technology as well as the increasing availability of public
information, data and online services, public services can be transformed. Coupling open public data
and services with information and services offered by the private sector can lead to innovative, userfriendly and personalised services that can be accessed easily.
Because of their size, knowledge and agility, SMEs are key actors for the provision of those innovative
services. The "apps" market for mobile devices is a very dynamic market, which mostly lacks
application specifically for the public sector. Engaging SMEs into the potentially huge public sector
innovation market is a challenge for local and regional public authorities.
The scope of this action is to provide support to innovative SMEs, including start-ups, for the design
and creation of innovative applications, in order to foster the delivery of mobile public services.
The aim is to help the interaction of citizens and businesses with public administrations. This may be
done through the combination of public and private sector services, through mobile technologies.
Although they may be first piloted in a local context – with the involvement of public administrations
and end users - the solutions need to ensure replicability, also taking into account multi-lingualism and,
where necessary, the cross-border dimension. Scalability and sustainability issues are to be
considered.
Scope: The SME instrument consists of three separate phases and a coaching and mentoring service
for beneficiaries. Participants can apply to phase 1 with a view to applying to phase 2 at a later date, or
directly to phase 2.
In phase 1, a feasibility study shall be developed verifying the technological/practical as well as
economic viability of an innovation idea/concept with considerable novelty to the industry
sector in which it is presented (new products, processes, design, services and technologies or
new market applications of existing technologies). The activities could, for example, comprise
risk assessment, market study, user involvement, Intellectual Property (IP) management,
innovation strategy development, partner search, feasibility of concept and the like to establish
a solid high-potential innovation project aligned to the enterprise strategy and with a European
dimension. Bottlenecks in the ability to increase profitability of the enterprise through
innovation shall be detected and analysed during phase 1 and addressed during phase 2 to
increase the return in investment in innovation activities. The proposal should contain an initial
business plan based on the proposed idea/concept.

The proposal should give the specifications of the elaborated business plan, which is to be the
outcome of the project and the criteria for success.
Funding will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50.000. Projects should last around 6
months.
In phase 2, innovation projects will be supported that address the specific challenge of business
transformation and that demonstrate high potential in terms of company competitiveness and growth
underpinned by a strategic business plan. Activities should focus on innovation activities such as
demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and
the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service etc) to industrial readiness and
maturity for market introduction, but may also include some research. For technological innovation a
Technology Readiness Levels of 6 or above (or similar for non-technological innovations) are
envisaged; please see part G of the General Annex.
Proposals shall be based on an elaborated business plan either developed through phase 1 or another
means. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants will have to
present convincing measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to
operate').
Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project, including a first
commercialisation plan, and criteria for success.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5
and 2.5 million would allow phase 2 to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not
preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Projects should last
between 12 and 24 months.
In addition, in phase 3, SMEs can benefit from indirect support measures and services as well as
access to the financial facilities supported under Access to Risk Finance of this work programme.
Successful beneficiaries will be offered coaching and mentoring support during phase 1 and phase 2.
This service will be accessible via the Enterprise Europe Network and delivered by a dedicated coach
through consultation and signposting to the beneficiaries. The coaches will be recruited from a central
database managed by the Commission and have all fulfilled stringent criteria with regards to business
experience and competencies. Throughout the three phases of the instrument, the Network will
complement the coaching support by providing access to its innovation and internationalisation service
offering. This could include, for example, depending on the need of the SME, support in identifying
growth potential, developing a growth plan and maximising it through internationalisation;
strengthening the leadership and management skills of individuals in the senior management team and
developing in-house coaching capacity; developing a marketing strategy or raising external finance.

Expected impact:
Enhancing profitability and growth performance of SMEs by combining and transferring new and
existing knowledge into innovative, disruptive and competitive solutions seizing European and global
business opportunities.
Market uptake and distribution of innovations tackling the specific challenge in a sustainable way.
Increase of private investment in innovation, notably leverage of private co-investor and/or follow-up
investments.
The expected impact should be clearly described in qualitative and quantitative terms (e.g. on
turnover, employment, market seize, IP management, sales, return on investment and profit).
Type of action: SME Instrument (70%)

Neben Horizon2020 stehen eine Reihe anderer europäischer Fördermittel zur Verfügung, welche
potenziell ebenfalls interessant für Kommunen und Verbände sein können.
Beispielhaft sei hier auf die folgenden Programme verwiesen, die im Zuge der aktuellen EUFörderperionde (2014-2020) teilweise noch nicht so weit ausdefiniert sind wie Horizon2020, jedoch
perspektivisch ebenfalls genutzt werden können.
